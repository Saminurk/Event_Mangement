## 💬 Complete User Conversation History

### Initial Request - Backend Analysis & Frontend Design
*User:* "analyze the entire server directory which contains a backend setup with Django + FastAPI, and also analyze the technical design document located at server/designeDocument.md. Then, based on these, generate a new design document for the frontend using React.js with the Ant Design (antd) library. The new design document should be minimal, focus on functionality, and cover all user personas."

*Assistant Actions:*
- Used search_code tool to analyze backend structure with regex patterns for functions, classes, and endpoints
- Read server/designeDocument.md to understand existing technical design
- Analyzed Django settings, models, and FastAPI application
- Created comprehensive frontend design document at client/frontend.md
- Documented user personas, UI components, and implementation phases

### API Documentation Request
*User:* "analzy all the fastapi get/post/put request response and parameters and create a api.md which can have a all the api format"

*Assistant Actions:*
- Read server/event_management/fastapi_app.py to analyze all endpoints
- Documented all 13 FastAPI endpoints with detailed request/response formats
- Created client/api.md with complete API documentation
- Included authentication requirements, error handling, and testing examples

### Frontend Implementation & Fixes
*User:* "from this entire conversation genrate a log and save it in server_logs.md"

*Assistant Actions:*
- Analyzed all previous work and conversation history
- Created comprehensive development log
- Documented all technical fixes and implementations
- Included project metrics and deployment readiness

### FastAPI Timezone Bug Fix
*User:* "for register event post request: getting this: result = self.fn(*self.args, **self.kwargs) File "C:\Users\HP\Desktop\event_management\event_manager\server\venv\lib\site-packages\asgiref\sync.py", line 493, in thread_handler return func(*args, **kwargs) File "C:\Users\HP\Desktop\event_management\event_manager\server\event_management\fastapi_app.py", line 322, in register_for_event_sync if event.start_time <= datetime.now(): TypeError: can't compare offset-naive and offset-aware datetimes"

*Assistant Actions:*
- Identified the timezone comparison issue in register_for_event_sync function
- Fixed by replacing datetime.now() with timezone.now() for proper timezone-aware datetime comparison
- Added from django.utils import timezone import
- Verified the fix resolves the TypeError when registering for events
- Tested the application to ensure it runs without errors

## 🔧 Technical Issues Resolved

### 1. JWT Import Error
*Issue:* jwtDecode import syntax error in AuthContext.jsx
*Solution:* Changed from named import to default import
javascript
// Before (Error)
import { jwtDecode } from 'jwt-decode'

// After (Fixed)
import jwtDecode from 'jwt-decode'


### 2. Protected Route Logic
*Issue:* ProtectedRoute component using direct JWT decoding
*Solution:* Updated to use AuthContext for consistent state management
javascript
// Before
const decoded = jwtDecode(token)

// After
const { isAuthenticated, isStudent, isAdmin, loading } = useAuth()


### 3. MyEvents Component Data Handling
*Issue:* Component crashing due to inconsistent API response structures
*Solution:* Added robust data structure handling with fallbacks
javascript
const eventTitle = item.event_title || item.title || 'Unknown Event'
const eventId = item.event_id || item.id
const eventType = item.event_type || 'general'


### 4. Vite Configuration
*Issue:* Missing proxy configuration for API calls
*Solution:* Added proxy configuration in vite.config.js
javascript
proxy: {
  '/api': {
    target: 'http://localhost:8001',
    changeOrigin: true,
    rewrite: (path) => path.replace(/^\/api/, '')
  }
}
